# 1. Relevance and Analysis of the Subject Area

At present, DevOps practices are gaining significant popularity because they address the problem of accelerating the software development process. This approach was once revolutionary and solved many issues between developers and system administrators, thereby improving both the quality and usability of the end product. This work is dedicated to this topic due to the effectiveness and popularity of the approach.

A labor market study in the IT sector, based on an analysis of job vacancies on LinkedIn in Poland, Ukraine, and Germany [2], revealed a rapid increase in demand for DevOps engineers. This is due to the fact that modern projects require not just developers or system administrators, but specialists capable of ensuring a continuous process of development, testing, and deployment of software products [1].

Modern software products are becoming increasingly complex; therefore, the issues of integration, deployment, and monitoring of information systems, along with subsequent scaling to meet user needs, are becoming more acute. Speed of development and stability must not exclude each other in order to ensure a high-quality software product.

To meet the current needs of the software development process, a modern DevOps solution has been implemented, based on the principle of “Infrastructure as Code” (IaC), and virtualization in the context of containerization to ensure fast infrastructure deployment and, as a result, system scalability. Another key aspect is automation through CI/CD, which accelerates the development process. Additionally, a database for storing time-based metrics with visualization was implemented, thus ensuring the necessary monitoring capabilities.

This solution is relevant and valuable in the market due to its flexibility and ability to address the modern challenges of various organizations. This assertion is based on a market analysis taking into account the requirements set by employers in technology companies. The infrastructure solution uses modern approaches to ensure effective task execution, thereby satisfying the key needs of the IT market and allowing the solution logic to be expanded.

# 2. Analysis of Existing Solutions

The evolution of computer technologies has led to the emergence of so-called cloud computing, which, due to its scale and cost-effectiveness, offers a wide range of services for working with infrastructure. The main advantages of cloud technologies include flexibility and scalability, security, compliance with industry standards, as well as the availability of ready-made solutions for infrastructure management and monitoring [5].

In parallel with the development of cloud providers, containerization technologies using Docker have evolved as a logical continuation of virtualization. Microservice architecture, based on containerization, enables the creation of distributed systems and efficient load balancing [6].

The next stage in the development of containerization was the introduction of the orchestration tool Kubernetes, which allows the management of a large number of containers and the creation of solutions resilient to high loads [7].

Another logical step in working with infrastructure in cloud environments has been the use of declarative languages for creating infrastructure, in particular Terraform, which enables more efficient infrastructure management and version control [8].

Modern architectural solutions that combine cloud technologies, containerization, and orchestration create a powerful foundation for the development of innovative products. They provide an unprecedented level of flexibility, reliability, and efficiency, enabling businesses to quickly adapt to market changes and scale their services according to user needs.


# 3. Problems and Solutions

One of the most significant challenges for businesses is the cost of deploying and maintaining infrastructure. The traditional approach involves purchasing hardware, hiring specialists for initial setup and ongoing maintenance. In addition, specialists are required to work with the software deployed on this hardware, which represents considerable expenses for the business.

The emergence of cloud providers can be compared to the era of mainframes, which were powerful servers equipped with all the necessary software. Due to their large scale of operations, cloud providers can lower infrastructure costs and eliminate the need to predict capacity requirements and perform hardware maintenance. Thanks to the global reach of such services, clients can scale their infrastructure worldwide in just a few minutes [9].

However, given the broad capabilities of cloud providers, resource management can become a serious challenge, as any manual changes to infrastructure components are risky and may lead to system failures. As a result, system recovery after such changes or errors occurring during program execution becomes more complicated. This problem can be addressed by the “Infrastructure as Code” (IaC) approach, which involves describing created resources using the declarative language Terraform. The presence of such code allows for version control implementation, which significantly simplifies the process of monitoring and managing the infrastructure state.

Another crucial factor influencing infrastructure deployment is containerization with Docker, which establishes a unified workflow between developers’ environments and the production environment. This simplifies application deployment in the production infrastructure since it eliminates the need for manual building, testing, and deployment in the production environment. Instead, all actions are performed on the developers’ side, and the result is transferred to production. To meet these requirements, the application should be implemented using a microservice architecture.

After implementing a microservice architecture, there arises a need for its effective orchestration with Kubernetes, which greatly simplifies the configuration and maintenance of infrastructure based on microservices.

Last but not least, it is critically important to automate the processes of building, testing, and deploying software to ensure uninterrupted delivery between developers and the production environment through CI/CD practices.


# 4. Problem Statement

Based on the analysis presented in the previous sections, it is necessary to implement a DevOps infrastructure using the following approaches and tools. The key tasks are:
* creation of a cloud infrastructure based on an orchestration tool with appropriate network configurations and virtual server settings;
* creation of a clustered environment using orchestration tools, which should ensure traffic balancing and solution scalability;
* preparation of a test project to be deployed as a container;
* configuration of a system for collecting, aggregating, and visualizing metrics from infrastructure components;
* implementation of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes for automatic code checking, building, testing, and deploying new application versions.

**Main functional requirements:**
* the infrastructure must be created, updated, and restored exclusively using the “Infrastructure as Code” approach;
* virtual servers must scale flexibly according to user needs;
* deployment of infrastructure for CI/CD and the application must be isolated;
* the infrastructure must use load balancers in the network topology;
* monitoring of all infrastructure components and automatic alerting about critical states;
* monitoring of application pipelines;
* automatic code checking using linters, testing, and deployment.


# 5. Conclusions for the Section
