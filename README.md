# 🇺🇸 Summary
This project was created to demonstrate my professional skills in architecture design, coding, implementing CI/CD practices, and deploying and managing infrastructure.

The project code can be used for personal, commercial, and educational purposes without requiring permission.

Please note that the developer is not responsible for keeping the repositories and documentation up to date with the latest industry standards. Additionally, the developer is not responsible for fixing bugs that may arise during usage or providing support for their resolution. Consider this when deciding on its use.

* Object of research – infrastructure for a web application.
* The aim of the thesis is to implement tools for continuous integration, delivery, deployment, and monitoring of a containerized web application. The main focus is on building an efficient, scalable, and manageable infrastructure using modern cloud technologies and the “Infrastructure as Code” approach.
* The qualification work examines various infrastructure types: local (based on Docker Desktop), cloud-based (using Google Cloud Platform), and orchestrated environments (based on Kubernetes). Their advantages and disadvantages are compared. An automated deployment system was implemented using GitLab CI/CD. Monitoring was configured with Grafana, Prometheus, and InfluxDB. The microservices-based “Online Boutique” application was deployed as a case study.
* The results of this thesis can be applied to implementing DevOps practices in IT companies, automating various types of infrastructures, and deploying other containerized applications in cloud environments.
